## JWGBS Scaffold tool *( the B is silent )*

JWGBS, despite it's name, aims to be a powerful tool for anyone who wants to
develop simple HTML websites with ease.

The main features of JWGBS are:

- [**J**ade][j] Template engine which replaces the standard HTML markup.
- [**W**atch][w] + [**B**rowserSync][bs] to serve your static server and synchronize (+ much more) your
changes in real-time across multiple devices, which is awesome!
- [**G**runt][g] as the task manager.
- [**B**ower][b] as the package manager.
- [**S**ASS][s] which extends the "simple" CSS language.

##### Install

`$ npm install` <br />
`$ bower install`

##### Build

`$ grunt` is the default task which creates the `dist/` folder for development
and preview. <br />
`$ grunt prepare` will create a 'production' like app with all the assets compiled,
compressed and minified. <br />
`$ grunt deploy` will deploy all the files generated by `grunt prepare` to an FTP.
